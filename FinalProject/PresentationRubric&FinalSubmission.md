# Final Project Presentation Rubric  
**Python Visual / Interactive Project**  
**Total: 100 points**

# Student Expectations Checklist (for slides)
Students should be prepared to include on their slides:

- Project overview: title, goal, summary  
- Visuals: screenshots or short demo clips  
- Code excerpts they personally wrote  
- Explanation of how their feature fits into the full project  
- A slide on AI usage (what AI helped with, what they modified)  
- Challenges, debugging, and lessons learned  
- Preparedness to answer technical questions  
- Backup: pre-recorded demo in case live demo fails  

---

# Instructor Notes
- Students must be prepared to pull up any part of their code on request.  
- Presentations should focus **more on code than visuals**.  
- Each student is graded **individually**, even though the project is a team effort.  


---

# Final Project Submission Requirements (ZIP Folder)

Each team must submit a **single .zip file** containing all project files.  
Your submission must include the following:

### 1. Full Project Code  
- All Python files, assets, images, sounds, and supporting code needed to run the project.  
- The code submitted must match the version demonstrated during the presentation.

### 2. README.txt (required)
Your `README.txt` must include:

#### (a) Program Summary  
- A clear description of what the program does.  
- Explanation of the main features and visual/interactive components.

#### (b) Setup & Run Instructions  
- Step-by-step instructions for installing required libraries.  
- Instructions for how to run the program from start to finish.  
- Any folder structure notes or file paths needed.

#### (c) Team Member Contributions  
- A list of each team member and a brief description of the feature/module they implemented.  
- This should match what each student presents during the presentation.

### 3. Optional (Recommended)
- A short recorded demo video in the ZIP folder (useful when the program is large or fragile to run).  
- Additional documentation or comments explaining design choices.
